            <br><br>Computer scientists are critical to the global infrastructure that underlie our communications,
             finance, health, energy, transport and many other vital systems. Are you interested in understanding the
              algorithmic complexity of problems, automating human intelligence, providing ubiquitous access to information
               and designing secure and eﬀective software and computer systems? If so, this course will prepare you for work
                in an exciting industry. <br><br>

        <h2 class="text2"><span>Computer Science - Infrastructure </span><br>TU857
            <br><br>Computer Science (Infrastructure) is about developing software and infrastructure 
            for applications ranging from those on smart devices to those in global corporations. This
             course provides the skills required to build data centres and networks, and to develop software
              securely, individually and in teams. Recent graduates work as software developers, software engineers
            and system administrators.

        <h2 class="text3"><span>Computer Science - International </span><br>TU858
            <br><br>This course will provide you with the knowledge and skills to work as a global software engineer or as an application developer, able to develop as needed in an ever-changing global industry.

            You’ll learn IT skills early on that are required in the international IT industry, including core software design
             and development skills as well as highly sought-after international skills such as global citizenship, software
              localisation, entrepreneurship, and creating webinars. You can also select to study a foreign language (German,
               Chinese or Korean).
